1, When should accessor methods be used?

With reference to the given article, I give my answers:

-If we are stuck in a legacy codebase that heavily uses getters and setters, sometimes we have no choice but to keep them for compatibility. 

-In frameworks that require getters/setters for data binding (like JavaBeans), they can be useful. However, according to the article, we should avoid over-relying on them. Instead, we should try to encapsulate behavior.

-Use accessors when we need to interact with external systems or libraries that expect them. 

-In use with established structures (when we know that our organization is not changing quickly).



2, If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructors in a class, which is known as constructor overloading. This means you can have more than one constructor with the same name but with different parameters.
